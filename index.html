                        <b>Derived Obsessed Graduate Students</b> (DOGS) is an online junior seminar for graduate students 
                        working in Derived Categories. The seminar takes place <b>fortnightly on Zoom</b>
                        (link: <a href="https://ucl.zoom.us/j/92051924258">https://ucl.zoom.us/j/92051924258</a>)
                        on <b>Tuesdays from 3pm to 4pm (UK time)</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        The goal of this seminar, above all, is to be useful to its audience. Rather than a more 
                        research-oriented seminar, we hope this seminar to be a place where we can teach each other 
                        what we've learnt so far in our PhD. This is because the fastest and best way to learn is to 
                        have someone who has spent hours learning something explain it to you!

                            Brill-Noether theory is a way to understand the
                            behaviour of smooth curves: it initially studied
                            line bundles and their sections, but after works of
                            Mukai, Lazarsfeld and others, (semi)stable bundles
                            are also of interest. After Bridgeland introduced
                            stability conditions, Bayer showcased a use for
                            curves on K3 surfaces, by demonstrating the
                            applications of wall-crossing. In this talk, I will
                            talk about Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles, give a brief
                            introduction to tilt stability on K3 surfaces, and
                            discuss works of Bayer and Feyzbakhsh.

                             Since the introduction of Bridgeland stability
                             conditions, a very interesting problem has been
                             that of constructing (proper) moduli spaces of
                             semistable objects. In this talk, I will explain
                             why the classical GIT approach fails in this case
                             and how the machinery of good moduli spaces and
                             intrinsic GIT can be employed to overcome the
                             issue, drawing connections between the two
                             approaches when possible.

                             noncommutative varieties. Lastly, I will outline
                             ongoing work on how the properties necessary for
                             the existence of good moduli spaces are preserved
                             within connected components of the stability

                            Kuznetsov component of a Fano hypersurface) with a

                            by Witten from viewing both sides as different
                            limit points of a physical theory (a GLSM), which

                            Bridgeland stability is notoriously hard to construct on 
                            varieties of dimension gt; 2. One promising workaround is 
                            to focus on the Kuznetsov component of Fano varieties - a residual 
                            piece of the derived category that often captures the 
                            essential geometric information. In this talk, I will explain 
                            the construction of stability conditions on Kuznetsov 
                            components using the machinery of quadric fibrations introduced 
                            by Bayer--Lahoz--Macrì--Stellari (arXiv:1703.10839). I will 
                            illustrate how this technique applies to cubic 3-folds and 4-folds, 
                            and poke at the curious cubic 5-fold creatures I have been exploring 
                            recently. If time permits, I will discuss some applications to moduli spaces.

                            One of the central aspects of this program is to show how quantum cohomology induces, via 
                            Bridgeland stability conditions, a sort of “canonical” semi-orthogonal decomposition of the

                            A conjecture of Orlov predicts that for two derived equivalent 
                            varieties $X$ and $Y$ over the complex numbers, there is an 
                            isomorphism between their cohomology that preserves the grading and Hodge 
                            structure. A few years ago, Taelman showed that the conjecture holds for 
                            hyperkähler varieties. In this talk, I will show how this generalizes to 
                            more general varieties carrying a symplectic form, under some assumptions. 
                            The main technical tool is the so-called LLV algebra; I will introduce it 
                            and explain its relevance to the problem.

                            The derived autoequivalence group of a variety has really 
                            interesting applications due to its connections to mirror 
                            symmetry and stability conditions. For a smooth projective 
                            variety X with an ample or anti-ample canonical bundle, 
                            Bondal and Orlov showed that the variety only admits certain 
                            "trivial autoequivalences". When the canonical bundle is 
                            trivial, however, then the autoequivalence group is much richer. 
                            As a relative analog of this fact, birational morphisms \(X \to Y\)
                            with trivial relative canonical bundle, known as a crepant contractions, 
                            could be expected to induce new derived symmetries. In this talk, 
                            I will construct autoequivalences induced by these contractions and 
                            characterise them as twists around spherical objects and spherical functors. 
                            This talk will mostly be examples based. We will consider some examples 
                            in which these autoequivalences exist and some examples in which they don't. 
                            We will hopefully extract some "hidden smoothness" and "spherical" criteria 
                            which allow us to construct these symmetries.

                            Working with triangulated categories in general, it is important to 
                            determine whether a given exact functor is fully faithful or not. In 
                            algebraic geometry, one often encounters exact functors of Fourier-Mukai 
                            type relating derived categories of smooth projective varieties. In my

                            criterion allowing to verify fully faithfulness of certain Fourier-Mukai 
                            transforms (built from projections and closed embeddings). The goal is 
                            to explain the role of normal bundles in such computations and to provide

                            been studied strongly in the last few years. However, 
                            sometimes it is difficult to obtain good descriptions on 
                            it. One method to studying is via representations of quivers, 
                            as they behave nicely and its derived category is rather tame. 
                            In this talk we are going to mention some past results which 
                            indicate where the derived category of sheaves coincides with 
                            the derived category of representations of quivers; which 
                            essentially happens when we have a tilting sheaf, or a strong 
                            exceptional collection. We expect to prove it and to give a 
                            small breath of what is happening behind such equivalence.

                            The rationality problem of the cubic fourfold is a classical problem 
                            which remains unsolved (though there is recent work of Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev-Yu 
                            that promises a solution). I will describe two approaches to this problem: 
                            one Hodge-theoretic (due to Hassett), and one using derived categories 
                            (due to Kuznetsov). Along the way, I will introduce Kuznetsov components, 
                            their properties and how they are related to K3 surfaces. If time permits, 
                            I will give an overview of a paper by Thomas and Addington, which shows that

                            Intersection theory (in the sense of Fulton) sets up intersections of 
                            objects considered only up to rational equivalence. This leads to nice 
                            numerics in intersections according to a principle of continuity. 
                            However, it's somewhat weird and unintuitive. A self-intersection of a 
                            line in the plane is clearly distinguished from the transverse intersection 
                            of two lines. Derived Algebraic Geometry produces a more rigid framework in 
                            which these degenerate cases are interesting to study. I'll talk about this

                            Let \(X\) be a smooth Fano threefold. Due to a theorem of Bondal-Orlov from the 90s, \(X\) is determined 
                            up to isomorphism by its derived category \(D^b(X)\). Since \(X\) is Fano, \(D^b(X)\) admits a semiorthogonal 
                            decomposition into a number of exceptional objects, and the orthogonal complement to them. It is 
                            a natural question to ask whether \(X\) is determined up to isomorphism by less data than the whole of

                            exceptional objects. This subcategory of \(D^b(X)\) is known as the Kuznetsov component \(Ku(X)\), and when

                            The preprojective algebra of a quiver is the quotient of the path algebra of the 
                            doubled quiver by certain commutator relations. This brief description hides many 
                            questions as to why such a construction is natural/useful: Why these particular 
                            commutators? What does preprojective mean? I will give a gentle introduction to 
                            preprojective algebras and use examples to demonstrate the classical definitions. 
                            Using results which relate the Coxeter functors and AR-translate to Serre functors 
                            on the derived category, I will show how the defining relations arise naturally from 
                            an explicit computation of the Serre functor. This derived construction gives a 
                            dg-algebra whose zeroth cohomology gives the classical preprojective algebra. If time 
                            permits, I will discuss the Serre functor as a composition of derived reflection functors 
                            from the point of view of HRS-tilting.

                            There is a notion of flat families of Bridgeland-semistable objects parametrized by 
                            an algebraic space, and correspondingly, there is a moduli stack parametrizing flat 
                            families of Bridgeland-semistable objects of a fixed character. There are many open 
                            questions about the geometry of these moduli spaces. One of the major questions is: 
                            when is there a projective coarse moduli space parameterizing S-equivalence classes of 
                            Bridgeland-semistable objects of a fixed character?
                            <br><br>
                            Bayer and Macrì defined a nef divisor on such moduli spaces and gave a description of 
                            the contracting curves. This led to a general way of showing the projectivity of these 
                            moduli spaces. The construction of the nef divisor is related to the classical 
                            determinant line bundle construction on moduli of sheaves. I shall start by giving an 
                            overview of both the theories and how they are related. In the end, if time permits, 
                            I shall add a few comments on the ampleness of the Bayer-Macrì divisor on K3 surfaces.

                        <div class="abstract">
                            Anything about mirror symmetry refers to some mysterious relationships 
                            between complex and symplectic geometry. Roughly speaking, homological 
                            mirror symmetry says that if you have some complex geometry X, there 
                            is a mirror symplectic geometry Y such that D^b(Coh X) is equivalent 
                            to the Fukaya category of Y, denoted Fuk(Y). In fact, starting from a 
                            complex geometry (think an algebraic variety) there isn't just one mirror. 
                            There's a family of mirrors living over a parameter space, which is 
                            sometimes referred to as the Stringy Kähler Moduli Space (SKMS). The 
                            fundamental group of the SKMS acts naturally on Fuk(Y) via monodromy, 
                            and by mirror symmetry, we expect to see this action carry over. The way 
                            it carries over is believed to be through spherical functors. 
                            My goal will be to explain some details of this story in the context of 
                            Calabi-Yau toric geometric invariant theory. I'll start off explaining some things 
                            about GIT, mainly focusing on examples, and see where we get to!

                            Bridgeland stability conditions have proved to be a useful tool in algebraic geometry and beyond. 
                            However, if one looks at the definition, the connection to geometry can seem quite mysterious. 
                            In this talk, I will introduce them and present some examples and applications.

                            algebras have hearts. Unlike dogs, a single category can have 
                            many hearts. Fortunately the zoo of hearts is not completely

                            much like how fans classify toric varieties.

                            Shigeru Mukai has constructed certain derived equivalences between an 
                            abelian variety \(A\) and its dual \(A^{\vee}\). These equivalences are 
                            called Fourier-Mukai transforms, named so for their similarity to the 
                            classical Fourier transform on \(L^2\) spaces. Given a smooth curve \(C\), 
                            one gets a derived autoequivalence on the Jacobian \(A = A^{\vee} = Jac(C)\), 
                            and given a finite morphism of smooth curves \(\beta : C \to X\), one gets 
                            a derived equivalence between the Prym variety \(A = Prym(\beta)\) and 
                            the GIT quotient \(A^{\vee} = Prym(\beta) / \Gamma\), where \(\Gamma\) is a 
                            group of torsion line bundles on \(X\). Motivated by mirror symmetry and 
                            geometric Langlands, this talk explores extensions of these derived 
                            equivalences to cases where \(C\) is singular and we compactify the 
                            Jacobians and Pryms. This is based on joint work with Emilio Franco and 
                            Joao Ruano in our preprint arXiv 2206.12349.

                            It can be daunting to leave the warm, cosy duvet of smooth varieties, no matter 
                            how much the minimal model program may tempt us. In this talk, we will take small steps by 
                            looking at nodal varieties using recent results of Kuznetsov-Shinder.
                            We will see how, at the level of the derived category, nodal singularities can sometimes 
                            be "absorbed" by producing a semiorthogonal decomposition into a "singular" component and 
                            a "smooth" component.
                            I will then sketch a proof of a very cool result which shows that for curves and threefolds 
                            admitting this kind of absorption, the singular component in the decomposition vanishes when 
                            smoothing the variety.
