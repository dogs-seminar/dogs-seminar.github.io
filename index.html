                        <b>Derived Obsessed Graduate Students</b> (DOGS) is an online junior seminar for graduate students 
                        working in Derived Categories. The seminar takes place <b>fortnightly on Zoom</b>
                        (link: <a href="https://ucl.zoom.us/j/95256182114">https://ucl.zoom.us/j/95256182114 </a>)
                        on <b>Tuesdays from 3pm to 4pm (London time)</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        The goal of this seminar, above all, is to be useful to its audience. Rather than a more 
                        research-oriented seminar, we hope this seminar to be a place where we can teach each other 
                        what we've learnt so far in our PhD. This is because the fastest and best way to learn is to 
                        have someone who has spent hours learning something explain it to you!

                            </h3>

                        <div class="abstract">
                            Anything about mirror symmetry refers to some mysterious relationships 
                            between complex and symplectic geometry. Roughly speaking, homological 
                            mirror symmetry says that if you have some complex geometry X, there 
                            is a mirror symplectic geometry Y such that D^b(Coh X) is equivalent 
                            to the Fukaya category of Y, denoted Fuk(Y). In fact, starting from a 
                            complex geometry (think an algebraic variety) there isn't just one mirror. 
                            There's a family of mirrors living over a parameter space, which is 
                            sometimes referred to as the Stringy Kähler Moduli Space (SKMS). The 
                            fundamental group of the SKMS acts naturally on Fuk(Y) via monodromy, 
                            and by mirror symmetry, we expect to see this action carry over. The way 
                            it carries over is believed to be through spherical functors. 
                            My goal will be to explain some details of this story in the context of 
                            Calabi-Yau toric geometric invariant theory. I'll start off explaining some things 
                            about GIT, mainly focusing on examples, and see where we get to!

                            bimodule cones, and  are locally two-sided tilting complexes by using

                            Shigeru Mukai first introduced a "Fourier functor" in the 80s, now known as the Fourier-Mukai transform, which has since been used extensively for derived equivalences in algebraic geometry. In this talk, I will cover some material around the following topics:

                            Bridgeland stability conditions have proved to be a useful tool in algebraic geometry and beyond. 
                            However, if one looks at the definition, the connection to geometry can seem quite mysterious. 
                            In this talk, I will introduce them and present some examples and applications.

                            algebras have hearts. Unlike dogs, a single category can have 
                            many hearts. Fortunately the zoo of hearts is not completely

                            much like how fans classify toric varieties.

                            Shigeru Mukai has constructed certain derived equivalences between an 
                            abelian variety \(A\) and its dual \(A^{\vee}\). These equivalences are 
                            called Fourier-Mukai transforms, named so for their similarity to the 
                            classical Fourier transform on \(L^2\) spaces. Given a smooth curve \(C\), 
                            one gets a derived autoequivalence on the Jacobian \(A = A^{\vee} = Jac(C)\), 
                            and given a finite morphism of smooth curves \(\beta : C \to X\), one gets 
                            a derived equivalence between the Prym variety \(A = Prym(\beta)\) and 
                            the GIT quotient \(A^{\vee} = Prym(\beta) / \Gamma\), where \(\Gamma\) is a 
                            group of torsion line bundles on \(X\). Motivated by mirror symmetry and 
                            geometric Langlands, this talk explores extensions of these derived 
                            equivalences to cases where \(C\) is singular and we compactify the 
                            Jacobians and Pryms. This is based on joint work with Emilio Franco and 
                            Joao Ruano in our preprint arXiv 2206.12349.

                            It can be daunting to leave the warm, cosy duvet of smooth varieties, no matter 
                            how much the minimal model program may tempt us. In this talk, we will take small steps by 
                            looking at nodal varieties using recent results of Kuznetsov-Shinder.
                            We will see how, at the level of the derived category, nodal singularities can sometimes 
                            be "absorbed" by producing a semiorthogonal decomposition into a "singular" component and 
                            a "smooth" component.
                            I will then sketch a proof of a very cool result which shows that for curves and threefolds 
                            admitting this kind of absorption, the singular component in the decomposition vanishes when 
                            smoothing the variety.
