                        <b>Derived Obsessed Graduate Students</b> (DOGS) is an online junior seminar for graduate students 
                        working in Derived Categories. The seminar takes place <b>fortnightly on Zoom</b>
                        (link: <a href="https://ucl.zoom.us/j/95256182114">https://ucl.zoom.us/j/95256182114 </a>)
                        on <b>Tuesdays from 3pm to 4pm (London time)</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        The goal of this seminar, above all, is to be useful to its audience. Rather than a more 
                        research-oriented seminar, we hope this seminar to be a place where we can teach each other 
                        what we've learnt so far in our PhD. This is because the fastest and best way to learn is to 
                        have someone who has spent hours learning something explain it to you! 
                        If you'd like to speak or have any other questions, please contact Michela Barbieri

                            Derived algebraic geometry (DAG) can be viewed as homotopical algebraic geometry relative, in the sense of 
                            Toën and Vezzosi, to the category of simplicial commutative rings. In this talk we will explore a new model 
                            for derived analytic geometry (DAnG), proposed by Ben-Bassat, Kelly, and Kremnizer, as homotopical 
                            algebraic geometry relative to the category of simplicial commutative complete bornological rings. I will 
                            also briefly mention some work I have done looking at representability of derived analytic stacks in this 
                            framework. 

                            This will mainly be an ideas/vibes talk and no knowledge of analytic geometry or infinity categories will 
                            be assumed!

                            Intersection theory (in the sense of Fulton) sets up intersections of 
                            objects considered only up to rational equivalence. This leads to nice 
                            numerics in intersections according to a principle of continuity. 
                            However, it's somewhat weird and unintuitive. A self-intersection of a 
                            line in the plane is clearly distinguished from the transverse intersection 
                            of two lines. Derived Algebraic Geometry produces a more rigid framework in 
                            which these degenerate cases are interesting to study. I'll talk about this 
                            a little bit, then actually talk about the homological methods I've used over 
                            the course of my doctorate (maybe even including a proof of a result 😲).

                            Let \(X\) be a smooth Fano threefold. Due to a theorem of Bondal-Orlov from the 90s, \(X\) is determined 
                            up to isomorphism by its derived category \(D^b(X)\). Since \(X\) is Fano, \(D^b(X)\) admits a semiorthogonal 
                            decomposition into a number of exceptional objects, and the orthogonal complement to them. It is 
                            a natural question to ask whether \(X\) is determined up to isomorphism by less data than the whole of 
                            \(D^b(X)\). A natural candidate for "less data" is the aforementioned orthogonal complement to the 
                            exceptional objects. This subcategory of \(D^b(X)\) is known as the Kuznetsov component \(Ku(X)\), and when 
                            \(Ku(X)\) determines \(X\) up to isomorphism a categorical Torelli theorem is said to hold.

                            The preprojective algebra of a quiver is the quotient of the path algebra of the 
                            doubled quiver by certain commutator relations. This brief description hides many 
                            questions as to why such a construction is natural/useful: Why these particular 
                            commutators? What does preprojective mean? I will give a gentle introduction to 
                            preprojective algebras and use examples to demonstrate the classical definitions. 
                            Using results which relate the Coxeter functors and AR-translate to Serre functors 
                            on the derived category, I will show how the defining relations arise naturally from 
                            an explicit computation of the Serre functor. This derived construction gives a 
                            dg-algebra whose zeroth cohomology gives the classical preprojective algebra. If time 
                            permits, I will discuss the Serre functor as a composition of derived reflection functors 
                            from the point of view of HRS-tilting.

                            Last week I talked about Bayer-Macrì nef divisor, which is a general way of showing projectivity of a 
                            Bridgeland Moduli space. But since there is no GIT construction available for Bridgeland Moduli spaces, 
                            existence of universal family is not at all easy to prove. There are other techniques such as 
                            using F-M transform and the "Gieseker wall", using exceptional collections and their "quiver region", 
                            etc. I can discuss these things if people are interested.

                            There is a notion of flat families of Bridgeland-semistable objects parametrized by 
                            an algebraic space, and correspondingly, there is a moduli stack parametrizing flat 
                            families of Bridgeland-semistable objects of a fixed character. There are many open 
                            questions about the geometry of these moduli spaces. One of the major questions is: 
                            when is there a projective coarse moduli space parameterizing S-equivalence classes of 
                            Bridgeland-semistable objects of a fixed character?
                            <br><br>
                            Bayer and Macrì defined a nef divisor on such moduli spaces and gave a description of 
                            the contracting curves. This led to a general way of showing the projectivity of these 
                            moduli spaces. The construction of the nef divisor is related to the classical 
                            determinant line bundle construction on moduli of sheaves. I shall start by giving an 
                            overview of both the theories and how they are related. In the end, if time permits, 
                            I shall add a few comments on the ampleness of the Bayer-Macrì divisor on K3 surfaces.

                            Anything about mirror symmetry refers to some mysterious relationships 
                            between complex and symplectic geometry. Roughly speaking, homological 
                            mirror symmetry says that if you have some complex geometry X, there 
                            is a mirror symplectic geometry Y such that D^b(Coh X) is equivalent 
                            to the Fukaya category of Y, denoted Fuk(Y). In fact, starting from a 
                            complex geometry (think an algebraic variety) there isn't just one mirror. 
                            There's a family of mirrors living over a parameter space, which is 
                            sometimes referred to as the Stringy Kähler Moduli Space (SKMS). The 
                            fundamental group of the SKMS acts naturally on Fuk(Y) via monodromy, 
                            and by mirror symmetry, we expect to see this action carry over. The way 
                            it carries over is believed to be through spherical functors. 
                            My goal will be to explain some details of this story in the context of 
                            Calabi-Yau toric geometric invariant theory. I'll start off explaining some things 
                            about GIT, mainly focusing on examples, and see where we get to!

                            Bridgeland stability conditions have proved to be a useful tool in algebraic geometry and beyond. 
                            However, if one looks at the definition, the connection to geometry can seem quite mysterious. 
                            In this talk, I will introduce them and present some examples and applications.

                            algebras have hearts. Unlike dogs, a single category can have 
                            many hearts. Fortunately the zoo of hearts is not completely

                            much like how fans classify toric varieties.

                            Shigeru Mukai has constructed certain derived equivalences between an 
                            abelian variety \(A\) and its dual \(A^{\vee}\). These equivalences are 
                            called Fourier-Mukai transforms, named so for their similarity to the 
                            classical Fourier transform on \(L^2\) spaces. Given a smooth curve \(C\), 
                            one gets a derived autoequivalence on the Jacobian \(A = A^{\vee} = Jac(C)\), 
                            and given a finite morphism of smooth curves \(\beta : C \to X\), one gets 
                            a derived equivalence between the Prym variety \(A = Prym(\beta)\) and 
                            the GIT quotient \(A^{\vee} = Prym(\beta) / \Gamma\), where \(\Gamma\) is a 
                            group of torsion line bundles on \(X\). Motivated by mirror symmetry and 
                            geometric Langlands, this talk explores extensions of these derived 
                            equivalences to cases where \(C\) is singular and we compactify the 
                            Jacobians and Pryms. This is based on joint work with Emilio Franco and 
                            Joao Ruano in our preprint arXiv 2206.12349.

                            It can be daunting to leave the warm, cosy duvet of smooth varieties, no matter 
                            how much the minimal model program may tempt us. In this talk, we will take small steps by 
                            looking at nodal varieties using recent results of Kuznetsov-Shinder.
                            We will see how, at the level of the derived category, nodal singularities can sometimes 
                            be "absorbed" by producing a semiorthogonal decomposition into a "singular" component and 
                            a "smooth" component.
                            I will then sketch a proof of a very cool result which shows that for curves and threefolds 
                            admitting this kind of absorption, the singular component in the decomposition vanishes when 
                            smoothing the variety.
